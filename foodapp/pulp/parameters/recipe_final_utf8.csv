Use the foil hanging over the edges as handles to remove the baked brownies from the pan (this requires some care as the brownies are not solid at this point). Fold the foil over the top so that the brownies are covered top and bottom with foil, and then put the whole thing in the refrigerator until cooled (feel the bottom center if you aren't sure). This prevents the edges from overcooking while allowing the center to finish baking and cool. If you omit this step, you may end up with an undercooked center and/or overcooked edges.* For the real chocolate lover, crumble about 50 grams (1å_ ounces) of a dark chocolate bar (one with about 70% cocoa content) into the [[batter]] and stir it lightly right before pouring the mixture into the baking pan.
